## Reimagining Records Management for Fire Departments and EMS

Fire-RMS is a modern, cloud-native records management system built specifically for fire departments and emergency medical services. Our platform combines enterprise-grade security, multi-tenant architecture, and intuitive user experiences to transform how emergency service organizations manage their data.

## Core Vision

We're building Fire-RMS because emergency services deserve better software. Most existing RMS solutions are:

- Built on outdated technology stacks
- Difficult to use and maintain
- Challenging to integrate with modern systems
- Expensive to deploy and scale

Fire-RMS addresses these challenges with a fresh, modern approach that prioritizes:

- **User Experience**: Designed with first responders in mind, minimizing administrative burden
- **Security & Compliance**: HIPAA-compliant, role-based access control with detailed audit trails
- **Flexibility**: Multi-tenant SaaS with options for on-premises deployment
- **Interoperability**: Modern API-first architecture for seamless integration
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Advanced analytics and reporting capabilities

## Technical Architecture Highlights

Fire-RMS is built on a modern technology stack:

- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication, fine-grained permissions with Casbin
- **Frontend**: React with Chakra UI for accessible, responsive interfaces
- **Infrastructure**: Containerized with Docker, designed for cloud-native deployments
- **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable to support organizations of any size

## Key Features

- **Incident Reporting**: Comprehensive NFIRS-compliant incident reporting
- **Personnel Management**: Track certifications, training, and availability
- **Asset & Inventory Management**: Equipment tracking with maintenance schedules
- **Scheduling & Staffing**: Intelligent shift management and scheduling
- **Inspections & Pre-Plans**: Mobile-friendly property inspections and pre-plans
- **Training Records**: Certification tracking and training management
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time insights and detailed reporting
- **Multi-tenant Administration**: Centralized management for departments of all sizes

## Project Status

Fire-RMS is currently in active development. We're working with select departments for early testing and feedback. While our codebase remains private, we're committed to advancing the state of emergency services software.

## Getting Involved

We're always looking to connect with:

- Fire departments and EMS organizations interested in early access
- Technical advisors with experience in emergency services
- Potential integration partners for complementary services
- Investors interested in public safety technology
